 In my story, you are able to choose between the life of a farmer, priest, and knight during the reign of Henry VII.  As was the case in those days, it was difficult to stay alive.  I tried to mirror that in my story, so there are more negative outcomes than positive.
 My story shows technical skills with Twinery.  I've also included some more advanced features like multimedia and formatting.  I think this shows that my skills in digital media are exactly what you need for this role.
